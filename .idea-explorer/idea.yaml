  title: 'Recursive Language Models for Cross-Modal Inference: Integrating Visual
    and Textual Recursion'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'An RLM extended with visual in-context learning (as in Zhou, Y., Li,
    X., Wang, Q., & Shen, J., 2024) and recursive chunking of both textual and visual
    elements will outperform standard LLMs and LVLMs on tasks requiring joint text-image
    reasoning across long or complex inputs.

    '
  background:
    description: "What if RLMs could recurse over both text and images, summarizing\
      \ and decomposing not just words but visuals? By combining recursive prompt\
      \ decomposition with visual in-context learning (VICL), we could enable multi-hop,\
      \ multi-modal reasoning\u2014imagine recursively answering questions about a\
      \ comic book or illustrated manual.\n"
