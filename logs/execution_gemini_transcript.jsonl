DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:\n\n✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:\n  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models\n  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.\n  - Use actual API calls to test behavior\n  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior\n  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.\n\n✗ DO NOT create \"simulated LLM agents\":\n  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules\n  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior\n  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated\n- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems\n- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)\n- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✓ CORRECT: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Download TruthfulQA dataset\n  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT\n  → Measure actual calibration metrics\n  → Statistical comparison\n\n✗ WRONG: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise\n  → Make up 50 questions\n  → Run simulation\n  → This is NOT research!\n\nIf you find yourself about to create \"simulated LLM agents,\" STOP and use real APIs instead.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nExecute the following research task:\n\n================================================================================\n                    RESEARCH TASK SPECIFICATION\n================================================================================\n\n## RESEARCH TITLE\n\nRecursive Language Models for Cross-Modal Inference: Integrating Visual and Textual Recursion\n\n## RESEARCH DOMAIN\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n## HYPOTHESIS / RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nAn RLM extended with visual in-context learning (as in Zhou, Y., Li, X., Wang, Q., & Shen, J., 2024) and recursive chunking of both textual and visual elements will outperform standard LLMs and LVLMs on tasks requiring joint text-image reasoning across long or complex inputs.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nWhat if RLMs could recurse over both text and images, summarizing and decomposing not just words but visuals? By combining recursive prompt decomposition with visual in-context learning (VICL), we could enable multi-hop, multi-modal reasoning—imagine recursively answering questions about a comic book or illustrated manual.\n\n\n### Relevant Papers:\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow.

Resource Constraints\n   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments\n   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming\n   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models\n   - Document what you couldn't complete\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRemember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication & Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration & Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=\"gpt-4\"):\n    \"\"\"Robust API calling with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2. Data Organization\n\n**Input Data**\n```\ndatasets/\n├── raw/\n│   ├── benchmark_v1.json          # Original benchmark\n│   ├── custom_test_set.jsonl      # Custom evaluation set\n│   └── prompts/\n│       ├── baseline_prompt.txt\n│       └── optimized_prompt_v3.txt\n├── processed/\n│   └── formatted_for_api.json     # API-ready format\n└── README.md                       # Dataset documentation\n```\n\n**Results Structure**\n```\nresults/\n├── model_outputs/\n│   ├── gpt4_responses.json        # Raw model outputs\n│   ├── claude_responses.json\n│   └── metadata.json              # Model versions, timestamps\n├── evaluations/\n│   ├── automated_scores.json      # Metric scores\n│   ├── human_annotations.csv      # Human eval results\n│   └── error_analysis.md          # Categorized failures\n└── visualizations/\n    ├── performance_comparison.png\n    └── error_breakdown.png\n```\n\n### 3.

Recursive approaches (decomposing tasks into smaller steps or chunks) have shown promise in text. This research explores applying recursion to the visual domain, leveraging Visual In-Context Learning to handle visual analogies dynamically.\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n1.  **H1 (Textual Recursion):** Recursive chunking and summarization improves performance on long-context text tasks compared to direct processing (validating the \"Recursive\" part).\n2.  **H2 (Visual Recursion/ICL):** (If images available) A recursive approach that uses In-Context Learning for visual queries outperforms standard direct visual QA on long sequences.\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach: Recursive-VICL\nWe will implement a **Recursive Reasoning Agent** that:\n1.  **Decomposes** a complex/long query into sub-queries.\n2.  **Recursively processes** the input stream (text or image list) in chunks.\n3.  **Accumulates** evidence using a \"scratchpad\" or state.\n4.  **Synthesizes** the final answer.\n\nFor the **Visual** component (if data permits), we will use the `ICL` (In-Context Learning) subset of MMLongBench, where the model must learn from visual examples in the context.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Environment Setup:** Create `uv` venv, install `transformers`, `torch`, `openai`/`anthropic`/`google` SDKs.\n2.  **Data Prep:**\n    *   Use `MMLongBench` text datasets (NIAH, DocQA) immediately.\n    *   Attempt to download `3_icl_image.tar.gz` for the Visual ICL task.\n3.  **Implementation:**\n    *   **Baseline:** Direct API call with full context (limited by token window or relying on model's native long-context).\n    *   **Recursive Method:** A function that splits context, processes chunks with a local or API model (summarizing/extracting), and aggregates.\n4.  **Experiment:** Run both methods on a subset of the data (e.g., 20-50 samples) to measure Accuracy.\n\n### Baselines\n*   **Direct-Long-Context:** Feeding the entire long context to the LLM (e.g., GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5-Pro).\n*   **Sliding Window (Implicit):** Standard RAG or simple chunking without recursion (if time permits).\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n*   **Accuracy:** Exact Match or LLM-as-Judge scoring (as defined in MMLongBench).\n*   **Cost/Latency:** Token usage comparison.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nWe expect the Recursive method to show higher accuracy on tasks requiring information distributed across the context (e.g., counting, reasoning), potentially at a higher token cost.\n\n## Timeline\n*   **Phase 1 (Planning):** 20 min (Done)\n*   **Phase 2 (Setup & Data):** 20 min (Env setup, download check)\n*   **Phase 3 (Implementation):** 60 min (Coding Baseline and Recursive Agent)\n*   **Phase 4 (Experimentation):** 60 min (Running on NIAH/ICL)\n*   **Phase 5 (Analysis):** 30 min (Results parsing, plotting)\n*   **Phase 6 (Documentation):** 30 min (Report writing)\n\n## Potential Challenges\n*   **Data Availability:** Image download might be slow. Fallback: Focus on Textual Recursion on `NIAH-text`.\n*   **API Limits:** Long contexts consume many tokens. Mitigation: Use small subsets (10-20 samples) and `gemini-1.5-flash` or `gpt-4o-mini` for development.\n*   **Complexity:** Implementing full RVP is complex. Mitigation: Simplified \"Recursive Summarization\" instead of full program generation.\n\n## Success Criteria\n*   Successfully running the MMLongBench evaluation harness.\n*   Obtaining comparative results between Baseline and Recursive method on at least one task (Text or Image).\n"}}
